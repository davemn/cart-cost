## What's in your cart?

Need a shopping calculator, but just want something light-weight, free (and open source!), and with no ads? Stick to your budget while you shop - open in your phone's browser, and add / remove items as you go. You'll see your total in real time, tax included.

## Why?

I created this for my own shopping needs, and as a pet project in Angular. It's also bite-sized, so should be a good place to start if you're looking for example Angular code that's not the well-worn TODO list app.
